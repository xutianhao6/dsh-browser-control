/**
 * Local WebSocket+HTTP bridge between one browser extension and dsh. The
 * extension connects OUT to `ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/ws?token=...`, so no
 * native-messaging host or registry setup exists; dsh drives commands through
 * {@link BridgeServer.execute} and reads link state through {@link BridgeServer.status}.
 * A small HTTP face (`/api/status`, `/api/command`, `/api/cleanup`, `/`) keeps
 * the bridge usable from curl while the server runs.
 *
 * Wire protocol (text frames, one JSON object each):
 * - extension → server: `{type:'hello',…}`, `{type:'pong',t}`, `{type:'result',id,ok,result?|error}`
 * - server → extension: `{type:'ping',t}`, `{type:'command',id,command,params}`
 *
 * Command names (sent in `command`) include: `ping`, `browser.info`, `tabs.list/open/close/activate`,
 * `nav`, `eval`, `content`, `find`, `click`, `input`, `press`, `scroll`, `snapshot`, `screenshot`,
 * `wait`, `dialog`, `console.log`, `network.log`, `network.clear`, `pdf`, `emulate`.
