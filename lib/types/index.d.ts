/**
 * Browser-bridge plugin: one local WebSocket endpoint the DSH Browser Control
 * extension connects to, plus the model-facing `browser_*` tools that drive
 * it. The Settings-managed `enabled` flag starts and stops the listener live
 * through dsh-settings' change hook — no reload needed.
 *
 * We deliberately bypass the higher-level `installSettingsSection` helper and
 * talk to the lower-level `sctx.settings.register` API directly: that API
 * predates the helper and is the one stable across every dsh-settings build a
 * consumer is realistically pinned to. Importing the helper on a build that
 * does not export it crashes the whole plugin at module load.
 *
 * Tools stay mounted whenever the plugin does; calling one while the bridge
 * is disabled or the extension is offline fails with a message naming the
 * fix, so the model can tell the user what to do instead of hanging.
 * @module @deepseek-ai/dsh-browser-bridge
